https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview

The purpose of this project is to utilize Natural Language Processing to aid in monitoring Twitter tweets as a source of news regarding announcement of a disaster. We are tasked with building a model that predicts which tweets are about actual disasters versus not. The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets that were previously classified. This project was also completed as part of the Introduction to Deep Learning course at University of Colorado Boulder for Week 4 content. 

The data is taken from a[kaggle competition which evaluates test submissions by F1 metrics.

The Best model trained from the project have the following hyper parameters:
Architecture: Model 4 LSTM RNN	
Learning rate: 0.000075	
Bidirectional layer: Y	
Optimizer: Adam	20	
Regularization: L2 & recurrent	
Regularization: 0.1	
Public leaderboard score: 79.03
